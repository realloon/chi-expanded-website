## New Narrator: Sexy Evil

Sexy Evil is the ultimate weapon created through genetic engineering by the ancient celestial mechanical clan. Countless settlements of Shenzhou colonists have been destroyed by her deadly claws. All that remains on the fringe worlds are ruins and legends about her venomous minions and dual form transformation. Sexy Evil enjoys stories with intense variability, where unpredictable events become the main theme. Additionally, every fifteen days, she orchestrates an attack by the fierce beasts of Shenzhou to satisfy her lust for slaughter.

## New Beast Gene

After conducting relevant research, genes can be extracted from beast corpses (obtained through the original gene extractor), each possessing powerful abilities.

## New Beast Attacks

### Snake

During long-range combat, Snake employs a wide-ranging sonic attack that induces dizziness in all affected colonists. In close combat, it uses its sharp poisonous fangs to tear into enemies, which are highly lethal. Furthermore, it periodically releases a wind shield that reflects all ranged attacks from outside the shield, while enemies within the shield continuously suffer cutting damage.

### Qiongqi

According to some survivors, Qiongqi possesses incredibly strong evasion abilities thanks to its Qiongqi Eyes (which rapidly assess incoming attacks, granting a 50% chance to evade any damage source). Qiongqi also identifies ranged units among enemies and charges at the farthest one within its range, particularly aiming for their heads, making each attack exceptionally deadly.

### Nian Beast

In the fringe worlds, few have encountered this terrifying behemoth. According to some Shenzhou merchants, it frequently launches attacks on colonists, even breaking into enclosed spaces. However, this creature is afraid of flames and explosive sounds, making firecrackers an effective restraint (other weapons only deal 10% damage to it).

### Sexy Evil

According to surviving spaceship merchants, Sexy Evil has two forms: humanoid and scorpion. Both forms of Sexy Evil are formidable opponents.
In humanoid form, Sexy Evil does not actively attack colonists. However, she periodically emits headache-inducing illusionary sonic waves, driving the most mentally sensitive colonists mad and causing them to attack their companions. In battle, she employs a trident to stab enemies, and the inverted horse poison on the trident inflicts intense pain, causing colonists to collapse instantly.
